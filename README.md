## Introduction

I was trying to mock instagram layout with 'React' and 'Semantic UI React' (an UI component library).

It's RWD.

## DEMO

### quickshot

The following is my output:
![igimitation](/demo/igimitation.png)

As a contrast, the following is the real instagram layout:
![igimitation_contrast](/demo/igimitation_contrast.png)

--------------

This project was build with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
